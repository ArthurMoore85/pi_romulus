Retropie ROM downloader

Based on Romulus, the Linux Retropie ROM manager, Pi Romulus is intended to fill a gaping hole
in the Retropie functionality.
It allows you to search for games for the Retropie that you already own and then downloads it
directly to your Retropie installation, no further work required.
What makes Pi Romulus so attractive, is that there is no need for any other computer system.
You dont need to switch on your laptop to download and transfer the games. Just hook up a
keyboard to your Retropie, or ssh into the Pi, search for the game, select and play.

Features:
* Searching ROMs (uses Emuparadise)
* Automatic detection of required emulator
* Automatic ROM extraction, if ROM arrives in an archive
* Places ROMs in the correct folder for direct playability

Technical Details
-----------------
Romulus is written using Python 2.7.
For it's GUI framework it makes use of the excellent npyscreen library.
